    question: "You wake up on your flight to Denver, where you're visiting your parents after months. As you look around, you feel a rising sensation like being on a roller coaster. It intensifies into weightlessness as the captain announces, “Prepare for a rough landing! BRACE BRACE BRACE!” Sitting in the emergency exit row, you see you're about 150 feet from the ground. Do you pull the emergency exit and jump, or brace with everyone else and hope the landing in the Colorado Rockies will be safe?",

    optionA: "Jump?",

    optionB: "Brace?",

    question: "You jumped from the plane just in time, landing in a grove of Douglas Firs and hitting the ground safely. It’s 3pm, and with only 4 to 5 hours of daylight left, you realize you have nothing but some gum, a paper clip, your wallet, and a broken phone. Your priorities are food, water, and shelter. You can either enter a cave to search for water or climb higher to get a better view of your surroundings. Do you choose the cave on the left or the mountain on the right?",

    optionA: "Cave?",

    optionB: "Mountain?",

    correctAnswer: "A"

  },

    question: "You’ve entered the cave, which is 50 feet in diameter. As the light dims, you hear flowing water. The cave splits into two paths: the right is a small hole to crawl through, leading to rushing water and a larger cavern. The left is a steep rock slab to climb, though you're unsure if it leads to the water. Do you crawl through the hole on the right or climb the rock slab on the left?",

    optionA: "Climb?",

    optionB: "Crawl?",

    correctAnswer: "B"

  },

  {

    question: "You get on your knees and crawl through the narrowing passage, following the sound of rushing water. As the sunlight fades, you continue, trusting you’re close. After 10 minutes, the passage opens up, but you can’t stand. The water is 10 feet below, and you’re parched from the plane jump and crawl. You can either turn back to the left or leap into the water on your right.",

    optionA: "Turn around?",

    optionB: "Leap into the river?",

    correctAnswer: "B"
